A simple generator for generating karma
(http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Karma) lessons.

You need to have karma (git://git.olenepal.org/karma/karma) installed
to generate a working lesson.

The main script is generate-karma-lesson.py. To get some help about the
different options:
./generate-karma-lesson.py --help

The templates directory contains the templates that are used by the
individual lessons in the lessons directory.

An example of generating a lesson:
./generate-karma-lesson.py -k <path to karma> lessons/what-is-this-word/description.py

Point your browser at 6_English_whatsThisWord_1_K/index.html, and you
are running the lesson.
