Often we have a number of lessons that are very similar, e.g. we have a number
of vocabulary lessons where the only difference is the pictures shown and the
words.

To avoid duplicating code we make a template and then a number of lessons,
which include that template.

As an example, you can have a look at template/vocabulary and
lessons/vocabulary-food.

The template directory contains CSS files, JavaScript files and assets
that are common to all lessons that use that template. It also contains a
description file for the generator.

The lesson directory contains CSS files, JavaScript files and assets that are
specific to one lesson. It contains a description file that includes the
the description file for the generator (by calling the include() function). You
generate the lesson by giving its description file as an argument to
generate-karma-lesson.py.
