Grep for TBD in the code.

* better checks and error handling: e.g. if you give a wrong argument to generate_karma_lesson, if a file doesn't exist, etc.
* documentation
* make header and footer more configurable: timer, clickcounter, score
* add html files to lessons: lesson plan, etc.
* add more vocabulary lessons
* make puzzle configurable: # rows x # columns
* vocabulary lessons: don't embed the words in the picture on the first page
* check that timer is always cleared, even when restarting a lesson.
* delay on interactive buttons, so that double-clicking does not answer two consecutive questions
* convert help.png to help.html for all lessons.
* help HTML content needs padding and styling
* ability to have multiple help files, displaying the right one based on the screen showing
* centralise common assets (correct / incorrect sounds)
* generation should use a standard folder structure to merge into EPaath framework
* have POT file for translatable strings, from which JSON language object is generated
* javascript library to apply translation strings (printf / plural rules)
* interface guidelines
* sounds are sometimes truncated (e.g. march in months-of-the-year lesson)
* in vocabulary-plants: if you quickly drag two objects, correct is only played once.

Bugs in existing lessons:
* vocabulary clothes: dress looks more like a suit
* images can be dragged in vocabulary lessons and what's this lessons
* you can drag images on the left to the puzzle area in the puzzle game and things will go awry (try first swapping two pieces)
* dragging the mouse in the second screen of the vocabulary games will select elements on the page
* 6_Maths_quickAddition_1_K: timer overlaps with play button, doesn't stop at end of lesson
* 6_English_whatsThisWord_1_K: doesn't have a link to ole
* 6_English_alphabeticalOrder_13_K: rhinosorous iso rhinoceros
* 6_English_crossword_10_K: the layout is completely messed up
* 2_English_hangmanNumbers_9_K: "There are one stoves"
* capitalization of titles of different lessons is inconsistent: e.g. What's this word/letter
* 2_English_animalIdentification_8_K vs. 6_English_whatsThisWord_1_K: scoreboard visible from the start (before play) + feedback message is different
* 2_English_matchingWordsAndObjects_23_K (and other matching lessons): cursor becomes pointer even when square is already matched
* 2_English_matchingWordsAndObjects_23_K: if you click twice on the same square, they disappear after a delay (you should click two different squares)
* 6_Maths_matchingAnglesAndShapes_5_K: the pictures are slightly clipped (also in generated version)
* 6_Maths_matchingAnglesAndShapes_5_K: nonagon and decagon pictures are swapped
* 6_Maths_setsPictures_6_K: score is a bit confusing, it just indicates the page. Replay doesn't reset the score, and doesn't start from the start.
* 6_English_crossword_10_K, 6_Maths_setsPictures_6_K: missing help
* 2_English_animalIdentification_8_K, 2_English_colourIdentification_8_K: only one of the two has byebye.ogg sound
* 2_English_directionOfArrows_1_K: background of options has white pixels
* 2_English_whatSomeoneIsDoing_15_K: "The cat is chasing the rat." It's a mouse.
* 2_English_whatSomeoneIsDoing_15_K: Click "Play Again" to restart. The button label is in Nepali.
* 6_English_multipleChoiceActionVerb_3_K: if you answer the last question, and immediately click the next button, you get the game over message twice.
* 2_English_colourIdentification_8_K: the say again button is not completely sensitive because it is partly behind the title.
* 2_English_directionOfArrows_1_K: background image too small? (big black box at bottom)
* 6_English_prepositions_11_K: 'infront' should be 'in front of', the options for tree are a bit weird (It's in of the house.)
* 6_Maths_SetMultipleChoice_7_K: you don't get the time to read the answer to the last question
* 2_English_whatSomeoneIsDoing_15_K: 'What Someone is Doing ?', better 'What is Someone Doing?'
* 2_English_whatSomeoneIsDoing_15_K: confusing interface. There are two next buttons on the page, the one at the bottom takes you to an exercise, the one at the top to the next screen. If you go to the exercise and then back, you start again at the first screen.
* 2_Maths_addingUpto10FunGame_3_K: image of ball is cut off at the bottom
* 2_Maths_addingUpto10FunGame_3_K: images can fall partly outside of their container
* 2_Maths_addingUpto10FunGame_3_K: it is possible (but not very likely) that an image is obscured by a number of other images (since the minimum distance between their midpoints is only 12 px). E.g. a ball (37 px across) can be obscured if you put balls 12px east, west, north and south of it.
* 2_Maths_addingUpto10FunGame_3_K: rounded corners are fuzzy
* 2_Maths_addingUpto10FunGame_3_K: if you play the game twice, the second time, the big gorilla doesn't disappear when you click it.
* 2_Maths_addingUpto10FunGame_3_K: when restarting, the speed doesn't reset
* 2_Maths_countingSheep_2_K: title needs to be translated to nepali
* 6_English_articles_7_K, 2nd screen: if you click on an answer, and then immediately on another picture, the question will disappear
