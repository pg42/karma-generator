Grep for TBD in the code.

* better checks and error handling: e.g. if you give a wrong argument to generate_karma_lesson, if a file doesn't exist, etc.
* documentation
* make header and footer more configurable: timer, clickcounter, score
* add html files to lessons: lesson plan, etc.
* add more vocabulary lessons
* make puzzle configurable: # rows x # columns
* vocabulary lessons: don't embed the words in the picture on the first page
* files ne_correct.wav and ne_incorrect.wav: get ogg files for these
* topbtn_right, botbtn_right: ids used multiple times (maybe use class?)

Bugs in existing lessons:
* vocabulary clothes: dress looks more like a suit
* images can be dragged in vocabulary lessons and what's this lessons
* you can drag images on the left to the puzzle area in the puzzle game and things will go awry (try first swapping two pieces)
* dragging the mouse in the second screen of the vocabulary games will select elements on the page
* 6_Maths_quickAddition_1_K: timer overlaps with play button
* 6_English_whatsThisWord_1_K: doesn't have a link to ole
* 6_English_alphabeticalOrder_13_K: rhinosorous iso rhinoceros
* 6_English_crossword_10_K: the layout is completely messed up
* 2_English_hangmanNumbers_9_K: "There are one stoves"
* capitalization of titles of different lessons is inconsistent: e.g. What's this word/letter
* 2_English_animalIdentification_8_K vs. 6_English_whatsThisWord_1_K: scoreboard visible from the start (before play) + feedback message is different
* 2_English_matchingWordsAndObjects_23_K (and other matching lessons): cursor becomes pointer even when square is already matched
* 2_English_matchingWordsAndObjects_23_K: if you click twice on the same square, they disappear after a delay (you should click two different squares)
* 6_Maths_matchingAnglesAndShapes_5_K: the pictures are slightly clipped (also in generated version)
* 6_Maths_matchingAnglesAndShapes_5_K: nonagon and decagon pictures are swapped
* 6_Maths_setsPictures_6_K: score is a bit confusing, it just indicates the page. Replay doesn't reset the score, and doesn't start from the start.
* 6_English_crossword_10_K, 6_Maths_setsPictures_6_K: missing help
* 2_English_animalIdentification_8_K, 2_English_colourIdentification_8_K: only one of the two has byebye.ogg sound
* 2_English_directionOfArrows_1_K: background of options has white pixels
* 2_English_whatSomeoneIsDoing_15_K: "The cat is chasing the rat." It's a mouse.
* 2_English_whatSomeoneIsDoing_15_K: Click "Play Again" to restart. The button label is in Nepali.
* 6_English_multipleChoiceActionVerb_3_K: if you answer the last question, and immediately click the next button, you get the game over message twice.
* 2_English_colourIdentification_8_K: the say again button is not completely sensitive because it is partly behind the title.
* 2_English_directionOfArrows_1_K: background image too small? (big black box at bottom)
* 6_English_prepositions_11_K: 'infront' should be 'in front of', the options for tree are a bit weird (It's in of the house.)
* 6_Maths_SetMultipleChoice_7_K: you don't get the time to read the answer to the last question
