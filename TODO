Grep for TBD in the code.

* make header and footer configurable
* add html files to lessons: lesson plan, etc.
* add more vocabulary lessons
* make puzzle configurable: # rows x # columns
* vocabulary lessons: don't embed the words in the picture on the first page
* rename Karma.rand to Karma.random
* if you include the template description.py before you call directory, and the template generates a file, the path will be wrong (cfr. what-is-this): either fix destination_path or add a check that directory is called before include

Bugs in existing lessons:
* vocabulary clothes: dress looks more like a suit
* images can be dragged in vocabulary lessons and what's this lessons
* you can drag images on the left to the puzzle area in the puzzle game and things will go awry (try first swapping two pieces)
* dragging the mouse in the second screen of the vocabulary games will select elements on the page
* 6_Maths_quickAddition_1_K: timer overlaps with play button
* 6_English_whatsThisWord_1_K: doesn't have a link to ole
* 6_English_alphabeticalOrder_13_K: rhinosorous iso rhinoceros
* 6_English_crossword_10_K: the layout is completely messed up
* 2_English_hangmanNumbers_9_K: "There are one stoves"
