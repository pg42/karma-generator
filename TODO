Grep for TBD in the code.

* make header and footer more configurable: timer, clickcounter, score
* add html files to lessons: lesson plan, etc.
* add favicon
* add more vocabulary lessons
* make puzzle configurable: # rows x # columns
* vocabulary lessons: don't embed the words in the picture on the first page
* rename Karma.rand to Karma.random
* if you include the template description.py before you call directory, and the template generates a file, the path will be wrong (cfr. what-is-this): either fix destination_path or add a check that directory is called before include
* scoreboard should be an option of footer (what-is-this.js, identification.js)
* .wav files in current lessons -> convert to .ogg (maybe in generator?)
* maybe throw out markup and roll our own. pros: remove work-arounds for bugs in markup, remove external dependency, more control over generated html

Bugs in existing lessons:
* vocabulary clothes: dress looks more like a suit
* images can be dragged in vocabulary lessons and what's this lessons
* you can drag images on the left to the puzzle area in the puzzle game and things will go awry (try first swapping two pieces)
* dragging the mouse in the second screen of the vocabulary games will select elements on the page
* 6_Maths_quickAddition_1_K: timer overlaps with play button
* 6_English_whatsThisWord_1_K: doesn't have a link to ole
* 6_English_alphabeticalOrder_13_K: rhinosorous iso rhinoceros
* 6_English_crossword_10_K: the layout is completely messed up
* 2_English_hangmanNumbers_9_K: "There are one stoves"
* capitalization of titles of different lessons is inconsistent: e.g. What's this word/letter
* 2_English_animalIdentification_8_K vs. 6_English_whatsThisWord_1_K: scoreboard visible from the start (before play) + feedback message is different
* 2_English_matchingWordsAndObjects_23_K (and other matching lessons): cursor becomes pointer even when square is already matched
* 2_English_matchingWordsAndObjects_23_K: if you click twice on the same square, they disappear after a delay (you should click two different squares)
* 6_Maths_matchingAnglesAndShapes_5_K: the pictures are slightly clipped (also in generated version)
* 6_Maths_matchingAnglesAndShapes_5_K: nonagon and decagon pictures are swapped
* 6_Maths_setsPictures_6_K: score is a bit confusing, it just indicates the page. Replay doesn't reset the score, and doesn't start from the start.
* 6_English_crossword_10_K, 6_Maths_setsPictures_6_K: missing help
